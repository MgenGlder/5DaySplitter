# 5DaySplitter
Your Workout Tracking App
by Kunle Oshiyoye


**What does it do?**
It will (when its done... soon) help you track your workout routine week by week. As the name implies, it will be most beneficial if you're trying some kind of splitting routine, whether it be a 5-day-split, 3-day-split, or just the splits. 

**What's left to be done? (TODO)**
  * Front-End -- Deciding on whether to use Angular or React. 
  * Tweeking backend MongoDB/Mongoose api interaction. 
  * Migrating test site to heroku server. 
  
**What Technologies does it currently use?**  
So far...
  * NodeJS
  * ExpressJS
  * MongoDB
  * Mongoose
  * PostMan (for testing api endpoints)
  
**How do I set this up so I can help?!!?!**  
Not too complicated but it does involve downloading and installing and setting up MongoDB which can be difficult if it doesn't like you.  
**I will update this section later when the project is more mature**
